# RVfpga:
RVfpga is a course centered around a RISC-V system implemented on an FPGA. It utilizes the open-source SweRV EH1 RISC-V core, running on a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA on the Digilent Nexys A7 development board. The SweRV EH1 core isn't just for learning; it's employed in real-world products like Imagination GPUs and Western Digital solid-state drives.
